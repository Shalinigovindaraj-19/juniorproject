           <p><li>I love living in New York sometimes. Its getting very dangerous though. 
                to the point were you cant even walk outside and hang out with friends and family. 
                </li></p><br/>
           <p><li>
                I love the opportunities that the city provides people interested in studying but is very expensive.
            </li></p><br/>
            <p><li>
                Such a diverse city with so many places to visit, 
                so many different people you could meet, and so many activities to do
            </li></p><br/>
            <p><li>
                I love the rush and bustle of the city and the transit system is the best. 
                This is the greatest city on earth.
            </li></p><br/>
